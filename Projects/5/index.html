    <h2> My favorite sports team </h2>

    <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
    
    <p> I am a fan of surf and turf.  I love eating meat and any type of seafood.  I love how meat is really tender in my mouth while seafood is salty and juicy.  </p>

    <h2> My favorite memories</h2>
    
    <p>When I was 12 years old, I went to Cooperstown, New York for a baseball tournament.  That tournament was a one week tournament where you were able to trade team pins and stay in the same bunks as your teammates for the tournament.  It was a great experience for me as a 12 year old because I was able to stay with my baseball team and enjoy a week of baseball and baseball related things.</p>
